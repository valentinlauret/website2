I'm a PhD student at the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/) supervised by [Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/). I'm a member of [Human-Animal Interaction group](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/) at the Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology ([CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/)).

My research is on applied biodiversity conservation, with a particular interest in interdisciplinary approaches. I use statistical ecology and social sciences and collaborate with wildlife managers and stakeholders to inform public policies.

Please, do not hesitate to [contact me](mailto:valentin.lauret@ens-lyon.fr) for any question or information ! :left_arrow: :postbox:
