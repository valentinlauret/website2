I'm a postdoc at the Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology ([CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/)) working with [Aur√©lien Besnard](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/actus/44-french/recherche/bc/bev/291-aurelien-besnard) as a member of [Human-Animal Interaction group](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/). I'm onboard the [Migralion](https://www.france-energies-marines.org/en/projects/migralion/) project with [France Energies Marines](https://www.france-energies-marines.org/en/), an ambituous research program funded by the [French Biodiversity Office](https://ofb.gouv.fr/en) aiming at studying birds migration in the Gulf of Lion (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea). I'm mainly in charge of developing integrated models combining telemetry, counts, and radar data.

Overall, my research focuses on applied biodiversity conservation, with a particular interest in interdisciplinary approaches using statistical ecology and social sciences to work with wildlife managers and stakeholders to inform public policies.
