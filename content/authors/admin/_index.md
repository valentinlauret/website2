I'm a Postdoc working for integrating spatial data into population modeling at the Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology ([CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/)) supervised by [Aur√©lien Besnard](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/fr/actus/44-french/recherche/bc/bev/291-aurelien-besnard) as a member of [Human-Animal Interaction group](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/). I'm onboard the Migralion project, an ambituous research program funded by the [French Biodiversity Office](https://ofb.gouv.fr/en) aiming at studying birds & bats migration in the Gulf of Lion (Northwestern Mediterranean Sea). I'm in charge of developing population models integrating telemetry, count, and ringing data.

Overall, my research focuses on applied biodiversity conservation, with a particular interest in interdisciplinary approaches using statistical ecology and social sciences to work with wildlife managers and stakeholders to inform public policies.
