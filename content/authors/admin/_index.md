I'm doing my PhD at the [University of Montpellier](https://www.umontpellier.fr/en/), in the [CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/) lab. Member of [Human-Animal Interaction group](https://human-animal-interactions.github.io/) and working with [Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/) and MIRACETI.

My research focus on applied biodiversity conservation, with a particular interest in interdisciplinary approaches using statistical ecology and social sciences to work with managers and public policies.
