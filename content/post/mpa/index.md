## An interdisciplinary study

For my PhD, I focus my research on biodiversity monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We use an interdisciplinary approach combining statistical ecology and social sciences to understand the ecological and institutional processes underlyin the monitoring of bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) by the French Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPA). My main objective is to develop statistical tools that will help to obtain reliable and robust ecological indicators with MPA data and based on what managers and stakeholders are in capacity to implement. 

## Large-scale monitoring of bottlenose dolphins is challenging

<justify>

I use the monitoring of bottlenose dolphins as a case study. Bottlenose dolphin is a vulnerable species within the Mediterranean waters and specific monitoring programs are mandatory. State institutions have to provide large-scale ecological indicators (abundance, distribution) to inform the Marine Strategic Framework Directive. Besides, bottlenose dolphins are an ubiquitous speices present all year long in all French Mediterranean MPA, which gives the opportunity to collect a lot of data through various protocols.

In this context, many MPA routinely collect data on bottlenose dolphins, but the diversity and heterogeneity in monitoring protocols (e.g., aerial line-transects, on-board photo-identification, opportunistic detection) make data integration challenging.  

In my PhD, I develop and implement integrated occupancy models to estimate species distribution, and combined distance sampling and spatial capture-recapture models to estimate population abundance and density. The statistical framework I propose will help cmaking the best use of available data collected by MPA and inform large-scale ecological indicators.  

I'll add more details soon. Do not hesitate to contact me for any information !
