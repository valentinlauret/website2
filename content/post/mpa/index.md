## An interdisciplinary study

My PhD focuses on biodiversity monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. We linked statistical modelling and social sciences involving marine protected areas managers to understand the ecological and institutional processes behind bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) monitoring by the French Mediterranean marine protected areas (MPA). Until the end of the PhD, we would develop statistical tools that help to inform ecological indicators with MPA data and based on what managers and stakeholders could implement. 

## More about the context

<justify>

Our approach uses the monitoring of bottlenose dolphins as the case study. This is a vulnerable species within the Mediterranean waters and specific monitoring programs for bottlenose dolphins are mandatory. Governmental institutions have to provide large-scale ecological indicators (i.e. abundance, distribution) to inform the Marine Strategic Framework Directive. Besides, bottlenose dolphins are ubiquitous speices present all year long in all French Mediterranean MPA, which lead to the collection of large datasets concerning this species.

Although many MPA collected routinely bottlenose dolphin data, many protocols coexist (e.g. aerial line-transects, on-board photo-identification, opportunistic detection) that impairs simple data integration. Developing integrated occupancy models and spatially explicit integrated population models, we try to provide statistical tools to help combining these various MPA datasets to inform large-scale ecological indicators.  

I'd add more details about the modelling part soon. Do not hesitate to contact me for any information !
