## Rodent outbreaks in Northern Spain


During Autumn 2017, I did an internship with Beatriz Arroyo, François Mougeot, and Miguel Delibes-Mateos at [IREC](https://www.irec.es/) (CSIC - UCLM) in Ciudad Real, Spain.  

We used Q-methodology, a quali-quantitative social science method, to describe shared opinions about Common vole (_Microtus arvalis_) outbreaks in Northern Spain. During this project, I conducted social interviews with farmers, hunters, conservationists, and members of the local government to idenitfy the coexisting viewpoints about this intense conservation conflict.
