### Current position 

I’m currently doing a Postdoc in Montpellier (France) at the  Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology ([CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/)) where I finished my PhD in October 2021. With [Aurélien Besnard](https://twitter.com/abesnardEPHE), we try to develop integrated models that can accomodate multiple ecological datasets collected about birds and bats migration in the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea). The larger goal of the Migralion project is to assess density and use of space of avifauna that migrate across these waters.



### Past

Previously, I did a PhD at the University of Montpellier supervised by [Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/) and Hélène Labach from the  MIRACETI NGO, we aimed at i) understanding how data collected by networks of marine protected areas can inform large-scale ecological indicators, and ii) focusing on the Bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) in the French Mediterranean Sea as a case study. This is a joint work with collaborators from the MIRACETI NGO. For more details, have a look at my [PhD project]({{< ref "/post/mpa/index.md" >}}).
With a generalist background in ecology, I specialized during my Master degree in statistics and modelling. After a project on [wolf recolonization in the Alps]({{< ref "/post/wolf/index.md" >}}), I decided to explore the human dimensions of conservation, and to get a training in social sciences. I worked with Beatriz Arroyo, François Mougeot, Miguel Delibes-Mateos in Spain doing interviews of various stakeholders in rural Spain to [investigate conservation conflicts]({{< ref "/post/spain/index.md" >}}). Since then, I have been really enthusiastic about multidisciplinary research environments, especially targeting applied topics on biodiversity conservation and management.
