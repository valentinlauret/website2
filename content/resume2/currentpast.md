### Current position 

I’m currently doing my PhD at the Univeristy of Montpellier. With my supervisor [Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/), we aimed at understanding how marine protected areas network could inform large-scale ecological indicators. We are using statistical modelling and social sciences to focus on Bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) monitoring in the French Mediterranean Sea. This is a joint work with collaborators of the MIRACETI NGO. For more details, have a look at my [PhD project]({{< ref "/post/mpa/index.md" >}}).

### Past

With a generalist background in ecology, I specialized my Master degree on statistics and modelling. After a project on [wolf recolonization in the Alps]({{< ref "/post/wolf/index.md" >}}), I decided to explore the human dimensions of conservation, and to begin learning social sciences. I worked with Beatriz Arroyo, François Mougeot, Miguel Delibes-Mateos in Spain doing interviews with various stakeholders in rural Spain to [investigate conservation conflicts]({{< ref "/post/spain/index.md" >}}). Since, I am really enthusiastic about multidisciplinary environments, especially targeting applied topics about biodiversity conservation and management.

Coming back to Montpellier for my PhD with Olivier Gimenez, we decided to build an [interdisciplinary PhD project]({{< ref "/post/mpa/index.md" >}}) including an important part of social science, and stastical modelling.
