### Current position 

I’m currently doing a postdoc in the [Institute for Game and Wildlife research](https://www.irec.es/en/) in Ciudad Real (Spain) where I started in January 2024. With [Beatriz Arroyo](https://irec.es/en/commitment/detail/brook-lopez-beatriz/) and [Miguel Delibes-Mateos](https://mdelibesmateos.wixsite.com/mdelibesmateos), we investigate the human dimensions of social conflicts associated with wildlife. In particular, I'm interested in the construction of ecological knowledge and its legitimacy for biodiversity decision-making, adopting a reflexive posture about the quantification of biodiversity through statistical models. Besides, I'm involved in multiple projects about ecological modelling of wildlife populations including Egyptian mongoose, European otters, Short-eared owl, etc.

### Past

Preivoulsy, I did a Postdoc in Montpellier (France) at the  Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology ([CEFE - CNRS](https://www.cefe.cnrs.fr/en/)) where I finished my PhD in October 2021. With [Aurélien Besnard](https://twitter.com/abesnardEPHE), we developped integrated models that can accommodate multiple ecological datasets collected to estimate space used by seabirds and migratory birds in the Gulf of Lion (NW Mediterranean Sea). This is the [Migralion](https://www.france-energies-marines.org/en/projects/migralion/) project, still ongoing.

I did my PhD at the University of Montpellier supervised by [Olivier Gimenez](https://oliviergimenez.github.io/) and Hélène Labach from the  MIRACETI NGO, we aimed at understanding how data collected by networks of marine protected areas can inform large-scale ecological indicators, focusing on the Bottlenose dolphin (_Tursiops truncatus_) in the French Mediterranean Sea as a case study. This is a joint work with collaborators from the MIRACETI NGO. For more details, have a look at my [PhD project]({{< ref "/post/mpa/index.md" >}}).
With a generalist background in ecology, I specialized during my Master degree in statistics and modelling. After a project on [wolf recolonization in the Alps]({{< ref "/post/wolf/index.md" >}}), I decided to explore the human dimensions of conservation, and to get a training in social sciences. I worked with Beatriz Arroyo, François Mougeot, Miguel Delibes-Mateos in Spain doing interviews of various stakeholders in rural Spain to [investigate conservation conflicts]({{< ref "/post/spain/index.md" >}}). Since then, I have been really enthusiastic about multidisciplinary research environments, especially targeting applied topics on biodiversity conservation and management.
